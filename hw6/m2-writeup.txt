What is one thing that you learned while doing M2?
What is one thing that surprised you while doing M2?
What is one question that you still have after doing M2?
Were you able to make any progress on your “one question I still have” from M1?  If so, please describe how it happened (eg, did you stumble upon the answer, did it come up in lecture, did you read about it yourself, etc).  If you did not, describe how you might find an answer to it.

In other words, which logic would you put in the schema and which logic would you put in Java?
